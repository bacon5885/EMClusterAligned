Functionality:

	Learn a re-configurable AND-OR template for input images.

	It performs two steps:
	1) EM clustering for rectangular regions inside the image lattice. The images are assumed to be aligned (not necessarily the same size).
	2) Learning an optimal partition of the whole object into rectangular parts (partition configuration) using dynamic programming.

Run StartFromHere.m in the Matlab. This produces the visual codebook for rectangular patches. And you can monitor intermediate results in output/.
Then run StartDP.m to learn the partition configuration.
